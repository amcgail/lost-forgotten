Streamlit (thank god) handles multiple users pretty well... https://github.com/streamlit/streamlit/issues/1960

It looks like I can deploy the streamlit package to something hyper-scalable.
There could be a big issue if for some reason or another I cannot scale this thing...
On the other hand, there shouldn't be that intense of server demand on this thing... Right?
If everything is precomputed, instead of computing & pushing to hard disk on demand...

I should be able to test a "burst" of hundreds of users at once, 
    to make sure I can handle such a surge *without* losing users... 

Fargate: https://aws.amazon.com/fargate/

    and here: https://github.com/nicolasmetallo/deploy-streamlit-on-fargate-with-aws-cdk

This seems like a useful, reproducible skill as well.
